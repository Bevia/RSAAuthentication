## Explanation:

### Generating Key Pairs: 
Key pairs for both Alice and Bob are generated.
### Printing Keys: 
The private and public keys for both users are printed in Base64 encoding.
### Signing Messages: 
Both Alice and Bob sign a challenge message using their private keys.
### Verifying Signatures: 
Each user verifies the other's signed message using the respective public key.
### Printing Results: 
The signatures and verification results are printed to the console.

When you run this code, you will see the RSA keys, the signed messages, and the verification results printed out, providing a complete view of the RSA authentication process.

In the example provided, Bob and Alice can assure each other of their identities through the use of RSA digital signatures and the exchange of public keys. Here’s a step-by-step description of how this process works:

### Steps for Authentication:

1. **Generate Key Pairs**:
    - Both Alice and Bob generate their own RSA key pairs. Each key pair consists of a private key and a public key.

2. **Exchange Public Keys**:
    - Alice and Bob exchange their public keys securely. In a real-world scenario, this can be done through a trusted channel or using a trusted third party to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

3. **Sign a Challenge Message**:
    - Alice signs a challenge message (e.g., "This is a challenge message") using her private key. This signature is unique to Alice and cannot be replicated by anyone who does not possess her private key.
    - Similarly, Bob signs the same challenge message using his private key.

4. **Transmit Signed Messages**:
    - Alice sends her signed message to Bob.
    - Bob sends his signed message to Alice.

5. **Verify Signatures**:
    - Bob uses Alice's public key to verify the signature on the message he received from Alice. If the verification is successful, it confirms that the message was indeed signed by Alice, thus authenticating her identity.
    - Similarly, Alice uses Bob's public key to verify the signature on the message she received from Bob. If the verification is successful, it confirms that the message was indeed signed by Bob, thus authenticating his identity.

### Assurances:
- **Authentication**: By successfully verifying the signature using the sender’s public key, each party can be confident that the message was signed with the sender's private key, thus confirming the sender's identity.
- **Integrity**: The signature also ensures that the message has not been altered in transit. Any modification to the message would result in a verification failure.

### Example Output:
```plaintext
Alice Private Key: ... (base64 encoded)
Alice Public Key: ... (base64 encoded)
Bob Private Key: ... (base64 encoded)
Bob Public Key: ... (base64 encoded)
Alice's signed message: ... (base64 encoded signature)
Alice's signature verified: true
Bob's signed message: ... (base64 encoded signature)
Bob's signature verified: true
```

### Summary:
- **Public Key Exchange**: Alice and Bob exchange their public keys.
- **Sign Message**: Each signs a challenge message with their private key.
- **Verify Signature**: Each verifies the other's signed message with the public key.

Through this process, both Alice and Bob can be assured that the other party is indeed who they claim to be, thus achieving mutual authentication.
